    <h1>Website Ideas</h1>
    <p>I want to make a travel blog. I've done a lot of travelling the last few years, and I have tons of pictures that just sit on my phone. A travel blog would be a way to use them, and I could write a little bit about each place. Each place could have its own page, and then I could break it into sections about the different things I saw and did there.</p>
