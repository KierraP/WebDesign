I think the Grid will be very helpful, especially for laying out pictures. Flexbox is a little more difficult. It's still the same basic principles as everything else we've been doing, but it is still proving to be a bit confusing. If I keep working with it, maybe it will click for me and I'll have it figured out. I do like that it makes things more consistent, and that's what is important to a coherent website. I think being able to copy and paste a navigation and footer that's already set up to each page is really efficient, and will make things much easier.
