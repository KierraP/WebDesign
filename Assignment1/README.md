# Reflection
<p>The peer feedback I incorporated into my design was, first, that I should make my pictures bigger, since they were slightly too small to see details. Upon looking at my page again, I agreed with that feedback, and did so. I also made all the text bigger to accomodate the bigger pictures.</p>

<p>Second, I incoporated a text-shadow into my top heading. Other classmates did this, and all the peer reviews seem to like it, so I decided to add it to mine. The top heading is on a white background, so that it sticks out, so I made the text-shadow purple in order to create consistency with the background color of the rest of the page.
