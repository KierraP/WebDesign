# Reflection
I am proud of my overall site. I like my layouts. I think they look consistent and organized. I had planned to do more location pages, but soon realized they were all so consistent that it became redundant and that for the purposes of this assignment a few would do. However, I would like to maybe finish the other pages in the future if I ever turn this into an actual website. 
I kept the layout and color scheme fairly simple since I knew I would be using so many images. I didn't want them to get lost in chaos. I think my brain also just really likes symmetry, so simple and symmetrical is just what I default to. If I were to continue this site, I would probably try to add a little more variation to things, but I went for a more streamlined layout for now. 
I had super basic coding skills at the beginning of the semester, as in, I could change some colors and insert pictures. So, pretty much everything we covered was something new I learned. I can definitely see myself using these skills in the future. I want to be an illustrator and write webcomics, so being able to make my own website for that purpose will be helpful.
